A utility for creating and exporting Minecraft resource packs, inspired by
[comp500's](https://github.com/comp500) work on [Packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)!

This is very incomplete as of now, but I plan on supporting things like
[Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) in the future.
